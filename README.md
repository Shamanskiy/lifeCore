# lifeCore
lifeCore provides an implemenation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
It contains a class that holds the game world and manages its evolution. While small game worlds can be visualized in the terminal,
the indended use of lifeCore is as an external dependecy for full-scale visualization apps with a proper GUI.

## Build
Use Cmake to configure lifeCore on your platform of choice.

## Demo
lifeCore comes with a small demo application `life`. It plots [Kok's Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillator_(cellular_automaton)) in the terminal:
